In this tune, I was trying to create a Reggaeton type of beat using as inspiration and doing research on how a Reggaeton music producer does it. I used the producers `"Tainy"`, and `"Sky Rompiendo"` for references

## Description:

This is a transcription of a song from Eslabon Armado & Peso Pluma. I have 2 different versions of a pluck string playing, a sharper one that I mapped as a "Requinto" and one that has more fill, and sounds with a bit more echo to imitate more the sound of an accoustic guitar.

 In this piece I was trying to experiment with the workflow of transcribing a music sheet into midi, then turn it into json, so it could be read by C++ directly on Allolib.
